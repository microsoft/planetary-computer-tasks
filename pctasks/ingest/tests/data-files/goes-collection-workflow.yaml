          title: GOES-R Cloud & Moisture Imagery
          description: "The GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) L2 Cloud and Moisture\
            \ Imagery product provides 16 reflective and emissive bands at high\
            \ temporal cadence over the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe GOES-R series\
            \ is the latest in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites\
            \ (GOES) program, which has been operated in a collaborative effort\
            \ by NOAA and NASA since 1975. The operational GOES-R Satellites, GOES-16\
            \ (or GOES East) and GOES-17 (or GOES West), capture 16-band imagery\
            \ from geostationary orbits over the Western Hemisphere via the Advance\
            \ Baseline Imager (ABI) radiometer. The ABI captures 2 visible, 4 near-infrared,\
            \ and 10 infrared channels at resolutions between 0.5km and 2km.\n\n\
            ### Geographic coverage\n\nThe ABI captures three levels of coverage,\
            \ each at a different temporal cadence depending on the modes described\
            \ below. The goegraphic coverage for each image is described by the\
            \ `goes:image-type` STAC Item property.\n\n- _FULL DISK_: a circular\
            \ image depicting nearly full coverage of the Western Hemisphere.\n\
            - _CONUS_: a 3,000 (lat) by 5,000 (lon) km rectangular image depicting\
            \ the Continental U.S. (GOES-16) or the Pacific Ocean including Hawaii\
            \ (GOES-17).\n- _MESOSCALE_: a 1,000 by 1,000 km rectangular image.\
            \ GOES-16 and 17 both alternate between two different mesoscale geographic\
            \ regions.\n\n### Modes\n\nThere are three standard scanning modes for\
            \ the ABI instrument: Mode 3, Mode 4, and Mode 6.\n\n- Mode _3_ consists\
            \ of one observation of the full disk scene of the Earth, three observations\
            \ of the continental United States (CONUS), and thirty observations\
            \ for each of two distinct mesoscale views every fifteen minutes.\n\
            - Mode _4_ consists of the observation of the full disk scene every\
            \ five minutes.\n- Mode _6_ consists of one observation of the full\
            \ disk scene of the Earth, two observations of the continental United\
            \ States (CONUS), and twenty observations for each of two distinct mesoscale\
            \ views every ten minutes.\n\nThe mode that each image was captured\
            \ with is described by the `goes:mode` STAC Item property.\n\nSee this\
            \ [ABI Scan Mode Demonstration](https://youtu.be/_c5H6R-M0s8) video\
            \ for an idea of how the ABI scans multiple geographic regions over\
            \ time.\n\n### Cloud and Moisture Imagery\n\nThe Cloud and Moisture\
            \ Imagery product contains one or more images with pixel values identifying\
            \ \"brightness values\" that are scaled to support visual analysis.\
            \  Cloud and Moisture Imagery product (CMIP) files are generated for\
            \ each of the sixteen ABI reflective and emissive bands. In addition,\
            \ there is a multi-band product file that includes the imagery at all\
            \ bands (MCMIP).\n\nThe Planetary Computer STAC Collection `goes-cmi`\
            \ captures both the CMIP and MCMIP product files into individual STAC\
            \ Items for each observation from a GOES-R satellite. It contains the\
            \ original CMIP and MCMIP NetCDF files, as well as cloud-optimized GeoTIFF\
            \ (COG) exports of the data from each MCMIP band (2km); the full-resolution\
            \ CMIP band for bands 1, 2, 3, and 5; and a Web Mercator COG of bands\
            \ 1, 2 and 3, which are useful for rendering.\n\nThis product is not\
            \ in a standard coordinate reference system (CRS), which can cause issues\
            \ with some tooling that does not handle non-standard large geographic\
            \ regions.\n\n### For more information\n- [Beginner\u2019s Guide to\
