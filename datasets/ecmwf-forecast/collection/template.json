    "description": "The [ECMWF catalog of real-time products](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/catalogue-ecmwf-real-time-products) offers real-time meterological and oceanographic productions from the ECMWF forecast system. Users should consult the [ECMWF Forecast User Guide](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/1+Introduction) for detailed information on each of the products.\n\n## Overview of products\n\nThe following diagram shows the publishing schedule of the various products.\n\n<a href=\"https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png\"><img src=\"https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a>\n\nThe vertical axis shows the various products, defined below, which are grouped by combinations of `stream`, `forecast type`, and `reference time`. The horizontal axis shows *forecast times* in 3-hour intervals out from the reference time. A black square over a particular forecast time, or step, indicates that a forecast is made for that forecast time, for that particular `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time` combination.\n\n* **stream** is the forecasting system that produced the data. The values are available in the `ecmwf:stream` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `enfo`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), atmospheric fields\n  * `mmsf`: [multi-model seasonal forecasts](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast) fields from the ECMWF model only.\n  * `oper`: [high-resolution forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast), atmospheric fields \n  * `scda`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, atmospheric fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\")\n  * `scwv`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, ocean wave fields (also known as \"high-frequency products\") and\n  * `waef`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), ocean wave fields,\n  * `wave`: wave model\n* **type** is the forecast type. The values are available in the `ecmwf:type` summary of the STAC collection. They are:\n  * `fc`: forecast\n  * `ef`: ensemble forecast\n  * `pf`: ensemble probabilities\n  * `tf`: trajectory forecast for tropical cyclone tracks\n* **reference time** is the hours after midnight when the model was run. Each stream / type will produce assets for different forecast times (steps from the reference datetime) depending on the reference time.\n\nVisit the [ECMWF's User Guide](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time) for more details on each of the various products.\n\nAssets are available for the previous 30 days.\n\n## Asset overview\n\nThe data are provided as [GRIB2 files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+GRIB+files+and+how+can+I+read+them).\nAdditionally, [index files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time#ECMWFOpenDataRealTime-IndexFilesIndexfiles) are provided, which can be used to read subsets of the data from Azure Blob Storage.\n\nWithin each `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time`, the structure of the data are mostly consistent. Each GRIB2 file will have the\nsame data variables, coordinates (aside from `time` as the *reference time* changes and `step` as the *forecast time* changes). The exception\nis the `enfo-ep` and `waef-ep` products, which have more `step`s in the 240-hour forecast than in the 360-hour forecast. \n\nSee the example notebook for more on how to access the data.\n\n## STAC metadata\n\nThe Planetary Computer provides a single STAC item per GRIB2 file. Each GRIB2 file is global in extent, so every item has the same\n`bbox` and `geometry`.\n\nA few custom properties are available on each STAC item, which can be used in searches to narrow down the data to items of interest:\n\n* `ecmwf:stream`: The forecasting system (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:type`: The forecast type (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.\n* `ecmwf:step`: The offset from the reference datetime, expressed as `<value><unit>`, for example `\"3h\"` means \"3 hours from the reference datetime\". \n* `ecmwf:reference_datetime`: The datetime when the model was run. This indicates when the forecast *was made*, rather than when it's valid for.\n* `ecmwf:forecast_datetime`: The datetime for which the forecast is valid. This is also set as the item's `datetime`.\n\nSee the example notebook for more on how to use the STAC metadata to query for particular data.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe products listed and described on this page are available to the public and their use is governed by the [Creative Commons CC-4.0-BY license and the ECMWF Terms of Use](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/).
