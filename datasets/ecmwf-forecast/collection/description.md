The [ECMWF catalog of real-time products](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/catalogue-ecmwf-real-time-products) offers real-time meterological and oceanographic productions from the ECMWF forecast system. Users should consult the [ECMWF Forecast User Guide](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/1+Introduction) for detailed information on each of the products.

## Overview of products

The following diagram shows the publishing schedule of the various products.

<a href="https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png"><img src="https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/aod_docs/ecmwf-forecast-coverage.png" width="100%"/></a>

The vertical axis shows the various products, defined below, which are grouped by combinations of `stream`, `forecast type`, and `reference time`. The horizontal axis shows *forecast times* in 3-hour intervals out from the reference time. A black square over a particular forecast time, or step, indicates that a forecast is made for that forecast time, for that particular `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time` combination.

* **stream** is the forecasting system that produced the data. The values are available in the `ecmwf:stream` summary of the STAC collection. They are:
  * `enfo`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), atmospheric fields
  * `mmsf`: [multi-model seasonal forecasts](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/Long-Range+%28Seasonal%29+Forecast) fields from the ECMWF model only.
  * `oper`: [high-resolution forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/HRES+-+High-Resolution+Forecast), atmospheric fields 
  * `scda`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, atmospheric fields (also known as "high-frequency products")
  * `scwv`: short cut-off high-resolution forecast, ocean wave fields (also known as "high-frequency products") and
  * `waef`: [ensemble forecast](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FUG/ENS+-+Ensemble+Forecasts), ocean wave fields,
  * `wave`: wave model
* **type** is the forecast type. The values are available in the `ecmwf:type` summary of the STAC collection. They are:
  * `fc`: forecast
  * `ef`: ensemble forecast
  * `pf`: ensemble probabilities
  * `tf`: trajectory forecast for tropical cyclone tracks
* **reference time** is the hours after midnight when the model was run. Each stream / type will produce assets for different forecast times (steps from the reference datetime) depending on the reference time.

## Asset overview

The data are provided as [GRIB2 files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+GRIB+files+and+how+can+I+read+them).
Additionally, [index files](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/ECMWF+Open+Data+-+Real+Time#ECMWFOpenDataRealTime-IndexFilesIndexfiles) are provided, which can be used to read subsets of the data from Azure Blob Storage.

Within each `stream`, `forecast type`, `reference time`, the structure of the data are mostly consistent. Each GRIB2 file will have the
same data variables, coordinates (aside from `time` as the *reference time* changes and `step` as the *forecast time* changes). The exception
is the `enfo-ep` and `waef-ep` products, which have more `step`s in the 240-hour forecast than in the 360-hour forecast. 

See the example notebook for more on how to access the data.

## STAC metadata

The Planetary Computer provides a single STAC item per GRIB2 file. Each GRIB2 file is global in extent, so every item has the same
`bbox` and `geometry`.

A few custom properties are available on each STAC item, which can be used in searches to narrow down the data to items of interest:

* `ecmwf:stream`: The forecasting system (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.
* `ecmwf:type`: The forecast type (see above for definitions). The full set of values is available in the Collection's summaries.
* `ecmwf:step`: The offset from the reference datetime, expressed as `<value><unit>`, for example `"3h"` means "3 hours from the reference datetime". 
* `ecmwf:reference_datetime`: The datetime when the model was run. This indicates when the forecast *was made*, rather than when it's valid for.
* `ecmwf:forecast_datetime`: The datetime for which the forecast is valid. This is also set as the item's `datetime`.

See the example notebook for more on how to use the STAC metadata to query for particular data.
