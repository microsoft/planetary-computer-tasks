The [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) program provides global imagery in thirteen spectral bands at 10m-60m resolution and a revisit time of approximately five days.  This dataset represents the global Sentinel-2 archive, from 2016 to the present, processed to L2A (bottom-of-atmosphere) using [Sen2Cor](https://step.esa.int/main/snap-supported-plugins/sen2cor/) and converted to [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.
