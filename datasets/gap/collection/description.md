The [USGS GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/573cc51be4b0dae0d5e4b0c5), based on the [NatureServe Terrestrial Ecological Systems](https://www.natureserve.org/products/terrestrial-ecological-systems-united-states), are the foundation of the most detailed, consistent map of vegetation available for the United States.  These data facilitate planning and management for biological diversity on a regional and national scale.

This dataset includes the [land cover](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/land-cover) component of the GAP/LANDFIRE project.
