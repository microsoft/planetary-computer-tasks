Global estimates of how land use pressures have affected the numbers of species and individuals found in an area. The dataset contains a _Biodiversity Intactness Index_, which is the modelled average abundance of originally-present species, expressed as a percentage, relative to their abundance in an intact ecosystem.

This dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/).
