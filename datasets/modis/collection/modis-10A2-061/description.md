This global Level-3 (L3) data set provides the maximum snow cover extent observed over an eight-day period within 10degx10deg MODIS sinusoidal grid tiles. Tiles are generated by compositing 500 m observations from the 'MODIS Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500m Grid' data set. A bit flag index is used to track the eight-day snow/no-snow chronology for each 500 m cell.
