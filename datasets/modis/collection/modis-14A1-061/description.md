The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies and Fire Daily Version 6.1 data are generated every eight days at 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. MOD14A1 contains eight consecutive days of fire data conveniently packaged into a single file. The Science Dataset (SDS) layers include the fire mask, pixel quality indicators, maximum fire radiative power (MaxFRP), and the position of the fire pixel within the scan. Each layer consists of daily per pixel information for each of the eight days of data acquisition.
