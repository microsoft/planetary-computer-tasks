The global 25m resolution SAR mosaics and forest/non-forest maps are free and open annual datasets generated by [JAXA](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/fnf_e.htm) using the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2), the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS PALSAR) and the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1 SAR).

The global forest/non-forest maps (FNF) were generated by a Random Forest machine learning-based classification method, with the re-processed global 25m resolution [PALSAR-2 mosaic dataset](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/alos-palsar-mosaic) (Ver. 2.0.0) as input. Here, the "forest" is defined as the tree covered land with an area larger than 0.5 ha and a canopy cover of over 10 %, in accordance with the FAO definition of forest. The classification results are presented in four categories, with two categories of forest areas: forests with a canopy cover of 90 % or more and forests with a canopy cover of 10 % to 90 %, depending on the density of the forest area.
