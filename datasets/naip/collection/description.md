The [National Agriculture Imagery Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) (NAIP) provides U.S.-wide, high-resolution aerial imagery, with four spectral bands (R, G, B, IR).  NAIP is administered by the [Aerial Field Photography Office](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/) (AFPO) within the [US Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) (USDA).  Data are captured at least once every three years for each state.  This dataset represents NAIP data from 2010-present, in [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.
