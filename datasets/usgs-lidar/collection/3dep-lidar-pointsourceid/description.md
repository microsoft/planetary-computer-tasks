This collection is derived from the [USGS 3DEP COPC collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/3dep-lidar-copc). It is a collection of Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs representing the file source ID from which the point originated. Zero indicates that the point originated in the current file.

This values are based on the PointSourceId [PDAL dimension](https://pdal.io/dimensions.html) and uses [`pdal.filters.outlier`](https://pdal.io/stages/filters.outlier.html#filters-outlier) and [`pdal.filters.range`](https://pdal.io/stages/filters.range.html#filters-range) to remove outliers and noise.
