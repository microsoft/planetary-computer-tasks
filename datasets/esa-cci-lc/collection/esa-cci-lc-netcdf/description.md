The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) [Land Cover dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview) provides consistent global annual land cover maps at 300m spatial resolution from 1992 to 2020. The land cover classes are defined using the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN FAO) [Land Cover Classification System](https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036361/) (LCCS). In addition to the land cover maps, four quality flags are produced to document the reliability of the classification and change detection. 

The data in this Collection are the original NetCDF files accessed from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home).
