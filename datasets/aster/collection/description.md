The [ASTER](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/aster) instrument, launched on-board NASA's [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/) satellite in 1999, provides multispectral images of the Earth at 15m-90m resolution.  ASTER images provide information about land surface temperature, color, elevation, and mineral composition.

This dataset represents ASTER [L1T](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/ast_l1tv003/) data from 2000-2006.  L1T images have been terrain-corrected and rotated to a north-up UTM projection.  Images are in [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format.
