Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Version 2.0 provides consistent surface reflectance (SR) and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution.  The HLSS30 and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiling and are “stackable” for time series analysis. This dataset is in the form of [cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/).  The HLS v2.0 data is generated by NASA's IMPACT team at Marshall Space Flight Center. The product latency is 1.7 days, from the satellite overpass to the HLS data availability at LP DAAC.
