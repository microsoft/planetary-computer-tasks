Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Version 2.0 provides consistent surface reflectance (SR)
and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the
joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI)
aboard the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites.
The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2-3 days at 30 meter
(m) spatial resolution. The HLS-S30 and HLS-L30 products are gridded to the same resolution and
Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiling system and are "stackable" for time series analysis.
This dataset is in the form of cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs. The HLS v2.0 data is generated by NASA's
IMPACT team at Marshall Space Flight Center. The product latency is 1.7 days, from the satellite
overpass to the HLS data availability at NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center
(LP DAAC). For more information see LP DAAC's
[HLS Overview](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/harmonized-landsat-sentinel-2-hls-overview/).

This collection contains HLS data collected from Landsat-8 and Landsat-9.
HLS data generated from Sentinel-2 satellites can be found in a separate collection.
