The [NOAA U.S. Climate Normals](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/us-climate-normals) provide information about typical climate conditions for thousands of weather station locations across the United States. Normals act both as a ruler to compare current weather and as a predictor of conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and other climatological variables for each weather station. 

NOAA produces Climate Normals in accordance with the [World Meteorological Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en) (WMO), of which the United States is a member. The WMO requires each member nation to compute 30-year meteorological quantity averages at least every 30 years (1931–1960, 1961–1990, 1991–2020, etc.), and recommends an update each decade, in part to incorporate newer weather stations. NCEI is also responsible for fulfilling the congressional mandate "... to establish and record the climatic conditions of the United States." This stems from a provision of the Organic Act of October 1, 1890, which established the Weather Bureau as a civilian agency (15 U.S.C. 311). The 1991–2020 U.S. Climate Normals are the latest in a series of decadal normals first produced in the 1950s. These data allow travelers to pack the right clothes, farmers to plant the best crop varieties, and utilities to plan for seasonal energy usage. Many other important economic decisions that are made beyond the predictive range of standard weather forecasts are either based on or influenced by climate normals. 

The science and methodologies used to generate official climate normals for the United States were well established during the creation of the 1981–2010 U.S. Climate Normals. A team of NCEI researchers spent considerable time and effort improving and automating these processes, particularly for daily and hourly normals. These methods are documented in a series of five peer-reviewed publications ([Applequist et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00173.1); [Arguez et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00197.1); [Arguez and Applequist 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-13-051.1); [Durre et al. 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-13-051.1); [Durre and Squires 2015](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00038.1)).
