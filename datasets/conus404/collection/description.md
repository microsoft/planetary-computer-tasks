[CONUS404](https://www.usgs.gov/data/conus404-four-kilometer-long-term-regional-hydroclimate-reanalysis-over-conterminous-united) is a unique, high-resolution hydro-climate dataset appropriate for forcing hydrological models and conducting meteorological analysis over the conterminous United States. CONUS404, so named because it covers the CONterminous United States for over 40 years at 4 km resolution, was produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations run by NCAR as part of a collaboration with the USGS Water Mission Area. The CONUS404 includes 42 years of data (water years 1980-2021) and the spatial domain extends beyond the CONUS into Canada and Mexico, thereby capturing transboundary river basins and covering all contributing areas for CONUS surface waters.

The CONUS404 dataset, produced using WRF version 3.9.1.1, is the successor to the CONUS1 dataset in [ds612.0](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds612.0/) (Liu, et al., 2017) with improved representation of weather and climate conditions in the central United States due to the addition of a shallow groundwater module and several other improvements in the NOAH-Multiparameterization land surface model. It also uses a more up-to-date and higher-resolution reanalysis dataset (ERA5) as input and covers a longer period than CONUS1.
