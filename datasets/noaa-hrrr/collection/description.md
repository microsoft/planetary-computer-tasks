The [High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/) is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model. HRRR runs are initialized by 3-km grids with 3-km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 minutes over a 1-hour period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly overarching 13-km Rapid Refresh (RAP) model.

The HRRR model is especially useful for short-term weather forecasting, including severe weather events, aviation weather, and renewable energy applications. The data are available in GRIB2 format and are delivered to Azure as part of the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination).
