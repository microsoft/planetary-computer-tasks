This Collection provides the Sentinel-3 [Synergy Level-2 Land Surface Reflectance and Aerosol](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-synergy/product-types/level-2-syn) product, which contains data on Surface Directional Reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness, and an Angstrom coefficient estimate over land.

## Data Files

Individual NetCDF files for the following variables:

- Surface Directional Reflectance (SDR) with their associated error estimates for the sun-reflective [SLSTR](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr) channels (S1 to S6 for both nadir and oblique views, except S4) and for all [OLCI](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci) channels, except for the oxygen absorption bands Oa13, Oa14, Oa15, and the water vapor bands Oa19 and Oa20.
- Aerosol optical thickness at 550nm with error estimates.
- Angstrom coefficient at 550nm.
