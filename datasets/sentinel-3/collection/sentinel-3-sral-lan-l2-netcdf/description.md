This Collection provides Sentinel-3 [SRAL Level-2 Land Altimetry](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-altimetry/level-2-algorithms-products) products, which contain data on land radar altimetry measurements. Each product contains three NetCDF files:

- A reduced data file containing a subset of the 1 Hz Ku-band parameters.
- A standard data file containing the standard 1 Hz and 20 Hz Ku- and C-band parameters.
- An enhanced data file containing the standard 1 Hz and 20 Hz Ku- and C-band parameters along with the waveforms and parameters necessary to reprocess the data.

More information about the product and data processing can be found in the [User Guide](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-altimetry/overview) and [Technical Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-altimetry).

This Collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files from March 2016 to present.
