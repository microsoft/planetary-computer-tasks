This Collection provides Sentinel-3 Full Resolution [OLCI Level-2 Water][olci-l2] products containing data on water-leaving reflectance, ocean color, and more.

## Data files

This dataset includes data on:

- Surface directional reflectance
- Chlorophyll-a concentration
- Suspended matter concentration
- Energy flux
- Aerosol load
- Integrated water vapor column

Each variable is contained within NetCDF files. Error estimates are available for each product.

## Processing overview

The values in the data files have been converted from Top of Atmosphere radiance to reflectance, and include various corrections for gaseous absorption and pixel classification. More information about the product and data processing can be found in the [User Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci/product-types/level-2-water) and [Technical Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-olci/level-2/processing).

This Collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files from November 2017 to present.
