This collection provides the Full Resolution [OLCI Level-2 Water][olci-l2] products containing data on water-leaving reflectance, ocean color, and more.

## Data files

This dataset includes data on

- Surface directional reflectance
- Chlorophyll-a concentration
- Suspended matter concentration
- Energy flux
- Aerosol load
- Integrated water vapor column

Each variable is contained within NetCDF files. Error estimates are available for each product.

## Processing overview

This collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files. The values in the data files have been
converted from Top of Atmosphere radiance to reflectance, and includes various corrections for gaseous absorption and pixel classification.
