This Collection provides Sentinel-3 [SLSTR Level-2 Water Surface Temperature](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/product-types/level-2-wst) products containing data on sea surface temperature measurements on a 1km grid. Each product consists of a single NetCDF file containing all data variables:

- Sea Surface Temperature (SST) value
- SST total uncertainty
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- SST time deviation
- Single Sensor Error Statistic (SSES) bias and standard deviation estimate
- Contextual parameters such as wind speed at 10 m and fractional sea-ice contamination
- Quality flag
- Satellite zenith angle
- Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) Brightness Temperature (BT)
- TOA noise equivalent BT

More information about the product and data processing can be found in the [User Guide](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/product-types/level-2-wst) and [Technical Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/level-2/sst-processing).

This Collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files from October 2017 to present.
