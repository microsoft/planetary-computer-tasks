This Collection provides the Sentinel-3 [Synergy Level-2 Top of Atmosphere Reflectance](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-synergy/product-types/level-2-vgp) product, which is a SPOT VEGETATION Continuity Product containing measurement data similar to that obtained by the [VEGETATION instrument](https://docs.terrascope.be/#/Satellites/SPOT-VGT/MissionInstruments) onboad the SPOT-3 and SPOT-4 satellites. The primary variables are four top of atmosphere reflectance bands:

- B0 (Blue, 450nm)
- B2 (Red, 645nm)
- B3 (NIR, 835nm)
- MIR (SWIR, 1665nm)

The four reflectance bands have center wavelengths matching those on the original SPOT VEGETATION instrument and have been adapted for scientific applications requiring highly accurate physical measurements through correction for systematic errors and re-sampling to predefined geographic projections. The pixel brightness count is the ground area's apparent reflectance as seen at the top of atmosphere.

## Data files

NetCDF files are provided for the four reflectance bands. Additional metadata are delivered in annotation NetCDF files, each containing a single variable, including the geometric viewing and illumination conditions, the total water vapour and ozone columns, and the aerosol optical depth.

More information about the product and data processing can be found in the [User Guide](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-synergy/product-types/level-2-vgp) and [Technical Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-3-synergy/level-2/vgt-p-product).

This Collection contains Level-2 data in NetCDF files from October 2018 to present.
