# Relesing

Releases are made through the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/microsoft/planetary-computer-tasks/releases/new).
Create a new tag for your release, using the format `<year>.<month>.<count>`.

You also need to update the`pc-test-gha-tags-release` Federated Identity Credential on the `PC Test GitHub Actions Deployment` App Regestration to match the new tag.
